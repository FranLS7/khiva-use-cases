# ELECTRIC CONSUMPTION RATE. CASE OF STUDY.

## Summary
This use case is going to be based on the analysis of the correct assignation of distinct electric consumption rates of 100 locals. 

In order to do this analysis, a predictive modelling is going to be used. 

The full use case is going to be based on a geographical research, features extraction (in order to identify the time series) and similarity research to get conclusions about the correct use of the electric consumption rates. 

It is supposed that the locals has the electric consumption rates corresponding to the kind of sub-industry which those locals have stablished. 

In this use case, the TSA library has been used in order to re-dimension the data, extract the features and compose the features matrix for the predictive modelling and get the similarity between the locals of interest. 

## Data

The data is stored in the shared Sinlogy:

* SYN_RS2416/datasets/data-enerNoc/

This folder should be located in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook provided in this electric-consumption-rate-python-folder.

> Note: The file time-series-redimension-applied.npy contains the data used to do the use-case after applying a re-dimension of the time series.
