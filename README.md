# use-cases

This repository contains Use Cases where the Khiva Library is applied. 

## Introduction 

The Khiva library is a library which target is to analise time series and its strong points are: 

* Features extraction.
* Time-series re-dimension.
* Distance comparison.
* Motifs detection.
* Discords detection.
* Similarity study.
* Statistics extraction.
* Time series normalization.


All these skills are enhanced with an incredible performance due to the parallelism that the library offers and the 
possibility that it provides us to be executed in GPU or/and CPU.

The library  is developed in C++ but it provides bindings in order to be used in different programming languages.
The available programming languages to use the library are:

* **C++**
* **Python**
* **R**
* **Matlab**
* **Java**

## What is this repository for? 

This repository aims to provide code, notebooks and presentations that supports and solve a full use case. 
In this way, the need for a library of these characteristics and its usefulness is explained. 

## What is the repository structure? 

In the root directory there are different folders focused on a topic and inside of these folders there are directories
 showing how a case of study related with this topic can be solved. 

> Note: Most of the data used in this repository is stored in the Sinology. Each use-case directory provides a README.md where the 
data location is indicated for the correct reproduction of the case of study.
