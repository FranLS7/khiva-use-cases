# Khiva's use-cases

This repository contains some Use Cases where the Khiva Library can be applied. 

## Introduction 

Khiva is an open-source library aimed at analysing time series and its key points are: 

* Features extraction.
* Time-series re-dimension.
* Distance comparison.
* Motifs detection.
* Discords detection.
* Similarity study.
* Statistics extraction.
* Time series normalization.


All these features are enhanced with an incredible performance due to the usage of accelerators, as the library can 
be executed in GPU or/and multicore CPUs.

The main library is developed in C++ and includes bindings for different programming languages.
The available languages for using the library are:

* **C++**
* **Python**
* **R**
* **Matlab**
* **Java**
